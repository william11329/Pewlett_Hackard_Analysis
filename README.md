# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview
In this project we were asked to deliver the number of employees retiring (by title)
as well as which employees would qualify to join a mentorship program. These deliverables
should help the company plan for the upcoming wave of retirees.

## Results
- our sorted count shows MANY employees are eligible to retire.
- it also shows the majority of those employees are Senior Engineers or Senior Staff.

- Through our second deliverable we can see that only a fraction of those are eligible 
to join the mentorship program.
- using the second deliverable we can also see which titles these employees hold.

## Summary
1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 
   - 90398 roles will be effected by the "silver tsunami" and that is how many employees you
   should be prepared to replace

2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
   - Based on the amount of qualifying employees for the mentorship program (1,940) I would say no.

### Possible insight
- the following query breaks down how many of each title can be used for the program, this may help decide 
how many people are assigned to a mentor
